        <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
          <p>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can be defined as the variations in the sequence of periods between consecutive heartbeats, and it is regulated by factors extrinsic to the circulatory system. Variability is the result of a trade-off between the influence of the parasympathetic system (accelerating the heart rate) and the sympathetic system (slowing the heart rate). This relationship was experimentally determined by Aselkrod in 1981 <a class="cite" href="#references">[Aksel81]</a>. Since then, its clinical usefulness in various pathologies such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, heart failure, transplantation, etc, has been studied <a class="cite" href="#references">[Malik95]</a> <a class="cite" href="#references">[Task96]</a>. The typical HRV spectrum of a healthy person at rest is mainly composed of two components: a low frequency band (LF), from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz; and a high frequency band (HF) ranging from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz.</p>

          <p>HRV analysis has been a very active research field for the last twenty years. Distinct techniques have been proposed in this area, such as spectral analysis, non-lineal techniques or time-domain methods <a class="cite" href="#references">[Achar06]</a> <a class="cite" href="#references">[Chang07]</a> .</p>

          <p>At the present moment, HRV analysis has not been established as a standard method for diagnosis. This has conducted providers of medical technology at excluding this type of analysis in their devices, and researchers depend on software applications in order to apply additional processing methods.</p>

          <p>The common factor for all the algorithms aimed at helping clinicians in the HRV analysis is the fact that the majority of them have been implemented by particular investigation groups, which are forced to develop their own and proprietary software, due to the lack of a common software package, easily accessible and downloadable, that fulfills the particular requirements of each research association.</p>

          <p>To perform this task, many programming languages are employed, such as Matlab <a class="cite" href="#references">[MatHRV]</a>,  Java <a class="cite" href="#references">[Bogu11]</a>, or even LabView <a class="cite" href="#references">[Nati09]</a>. Other software packages also deserve comment, such as the Kubios-HRV <a class="cite" href="#references">[Tarv14]</a>.</p>

          <p>Many applications can be found in the literature, including generation of correlated discrete ordinal data arising from longitudinal studies of medical research <a class="cite" href="#references">[Ibra11]</a>, detection of breast cancer <a class="cite" href="#references">[Roca12]</a>, population pharmacokinetic modeling for analyzing drugs effects and individual variations <a class="cite" href="#references">[Sun11]</a>, or time-series analysis <a class="cite" href="#references">[Koso11]</a>.</p>

          <p>Due to the growing scientific community developing specific software, and attending to the requirements of researchers, that usually need to unify software functionality into one open source and easily extendible tool, we have developed <strong>gHRV</strong>, a software package for HRV analysis (partially based on RHRV <a class="cite" href="#references">[Rodr11]</a>), in an attempt to help clinicians in the analysis of the heart rate. <strong>gHRV</strong> offers a powerful and simple graphical interface. Central ideas behind its design are easy of installation and of use.</p>

          <p><strong>gHRV</strong> has been implemented employing Python <a class="cite" href="#references">[Pyth]</a>, based on object oriented programming (although it also supports imperative and functional programming), giving clean and legible code, which improves software maintenance. Besides, it makes a quite efficient use of memory and it is very extensible, thanks to libraries available to programmers. These advantages make Python one of the ten most used programming languages in this moment. Appart from these benefits, Python provides:</p>
            <p><ul><li>A high grade of efficiency and portability.</li>
              <li>Efficient and flexible libraries, which allow to implement a graphical interface, advanced mathematical functions and highly customizable plotting capability.</li>
              <li>Developing tools (IDEs or Integrated Development Environments, compilers, debuggers...) freely available for distinct operating systems.</li>
            </ul></p>

          <p><strong>gHRV</strong> is a simple and easy-to-use graphical interface, and guided interaction with the user is performed in order to minimize errors and functional problems. With this purpose, the interface enables or disables interactive elements depending on the state of the interaction.</p>

          <p>An important functionality of <strong>gHRV</strong> is the possibility to deal with different episodes (apnea, ischemia,...), creating or adding new episodes or deleting existing ones, and to obtain time evolution of power in frequency bands.</p>

          <p>The following main functionalities are provided:</p>
          <p><ul>
            <li>Heartbeats: file loading and exporting, automatic filtering, manual filtering and interpolation.</li>
            <li>Episodes: file loading, removing all episodes and editing.</li>
            <li>Frame-based evolution: time evolution of power in frequency bands, and non-linear and temporal parameters.</li>
            <li>Poincar&eacute; plots: representation of the Poincar&eacute; plots of the RR (beat-to-beat) intervals.</li>
            <li>Significance analysis: statistical analysis of spectral parameters, in and out episodes.</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>Details of the implementation and installation instructions are given on the following.</p>

        <h3>OSX</h3>

        <p>To uninstall <strong>gHRV</strong>, just drag the <strong>gHRV</strong> program from the <strong>Applications</strong> folder to the <strong>Trash</strong> folder.</p>

        <h3>Deb-based linux systems</h3>

        <p>To uninstall <strong>gHRV</strong>, open a terminal and use the command:</p>

        <pre>$ sudo apt-get remove ghrv</pre>


        <h2 id="gs:up">Updating <strong>gHRV</strong></h2>

        <p>To update <strong>gHRV</strong> to a newer version, just make a new install with the procedure decribed above. The installation procedure updates the program automatically.</p>

        <h2 id="gs:ki">Known Issues </h2>

        <h3>OSX</h3>

        <p>There is some focus problem in OSX implementation of wxpython libraries. The effect of this problem is that sometimes, just after running <strong>gHRV</strong>, new windows are not shown. Normally, clicking on the <strong>gHRV</strong> icon in the dock solves this problem.</p>

        <h3>Deb-based linux systems</h3>

        <p>If Linux version is called from a terminal, there maybe a warning (Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to retrieve the file info...) in the terminal when saving a new project. This is caused by the implementation of file dialogs in some libraries. Users can ignore this message since the file is saved correctly.</p>

        <h1 id="ugs">Using gHRV Software</h1>

        <h2 id="ugs:rg">Running <strong>gHRV</strong></h2>

        <h2 id="ugs:hp">Heart Rate Data Panel</h2>
        <p><strong>gHRV</strong> reads different heart rate data file formats: Polar, Suunto, ASCII (beats and RR series) and WFDB (qrs) beats files. As an example, you can download from the <a href="http://milegroup.github.com/ghrv/doc.html"> http://milegroup.github.com/ghrv/doc.html </a> the file <strong>beat_ascii.txt</strong>, where data are in a single-column ascii file, indicating the beats position from a previously annotated ECG file.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure18.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Accepted format file for heart rate data</p>   

        <p>The instantaneous heart rate can be defined as the inverse of the time separation between two consecutive heart beats. Once the beats have been loaded, the heart rate is calculated. In mathematical terms, this corresponds to the calculation of the series:</p>

        <pre>HR(i)=1000/[T(i)-T(i-1)]</pre>

        <p>where HR(i) is the instantaneous heart rate, and T(i) is the position of the i-th beat, measured in milliseconds.</p>

        <h3>Load</h3>
        <p>To load a heart rate data file, just click on <strong>Load</strong>, and select the corresponding file.</p>

        <h2 id="ugs:ep">Episodes Panel</h2>

        <p>In many ocasions, ECG files may be accompanied by episode files, reflecting specific situations of ischemia or apnea, for example. With <strong>gHRV</strong>, functions for loading and editing these episodes are provided.</p>

        <p>The data corresponding to these episodes can also be incorporated to the <strong>gHRV</strong> analysis. To perform this, data should be in the format provided in the apnea_ascii.txt file, available at the web page  <a href="http://milegroup.github.com/ghrv/packages.html"> http://milegroup.github.com/ghrv/packages.html</a>.</p>

        <p>Each file line must contain the begin time (Init_Time), a tag identifying the type of episode (Resp_Events) and its duration (Durat). Some episodes files contain also a numerical value associated with the episode (SaO2 in the example) that is not read by <strong>gHRV</strong>.</p>


        <img src="docfigures/Figure26.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Accepted format file for episodes data</p>

        <p>Episodes contained in WFDB records can be read too.</p>

        <p class="imgtxt"> Options for the tools panel </p>

        <h3>Interpolate</h3>
        <p>This button interpolates the heart rate signal, applying a linear interpolation. The default frequency for interpolation is 4 Hz, even although it can be modified in the <strong>Config</strong> option of the <strong>gHRV Panel</strong> (this will be explained in the corresponding Section of this Manual). A new heart rate signal adequate for Fourier  spectral analysis appears in the graphical window, preserving the episodes information (if present).</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure34.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt"> Interpolated signal in <strong>gHRV</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Interpolation</strong> button is now disabled, and it becomes possible to click in the <strong>Frame-based evolution</strong> button for performing spectral analysis.</p>

        <h3>Frame-based evolution</h3>

        <p>In order to estimate the spectral power, spectrogram of the signal is first calculated, employing the SHort-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). A Hamming window is used with default values of width and shift of 120 and 60 sec., respectively. These default values can be modified in the <strong>Config</strong> option of the <strong>gHRV</strong> panel. Next, the power in various spectral bands is obtained:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>ULF: power in the ULF band (0.0-0.03 Hz).</li>
          <li>VLF: power in the VLF band (0.03-0.05 Hz).</li>
          <li>LF: power in the LF band (0.05-0.15 Hz).</li>
          <li>HF: power in the HF band (0.15-0.4Hz).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These limits for the bands can be modified in the <strong>Config</strong> option from the <strong>gHRV</strong> panel. Other parameters are also calculated:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>LF/HF ratio: defined as the ratio for the LF and the HF bands.</li>
          <li>Power: total value for the spectral power.</li>
          <li>Mean HR: mean heart rate value.</li>
          <li>HR STD: heart rate standard deviation.</li>
          <li>pNN50: percentage of differences between adjacent intervals that are >50 msec.</li>
          <li>rMSSD: square root of the mean of the squares of the differences between adjacent intervals.</li>
          <li>ApEn: approximate entropy.</li>
          <li>FracDim: fractal dimension. </li>
          <li>Heart rate: data employed to perform the analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For performing spectral analysis, just click the <strong>Frame-based evolution </strong> button, and a window indicating the calculation process in progress will appear.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure35.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt"> Frame-based evolution calculation </p>

        <h3>PoincarÃ© Plot</h3>

        <p>The last button of the <strong>Tools Panel</strong> is for obtaining the <strong>PoincarÃ© plot</strong>, useful for quantifying the self-similarity of signals by representing a scatterplot of each RR interval against the preceding ones. <strong>PoincarÃ© plots</strong> provide global and detailed beat-to-beat information on the heart behavior.</p>

        <p>By clicking on the <strong>PoincarÃ© plot</strong> button, a plot for the whole record is presented on a new window.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure41.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
